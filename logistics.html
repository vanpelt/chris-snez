  <h3 class="first">It all happens, September 26th 2009</h3>
  <p>"B" is set to take place at 3:45pm.  At 5:45 the party will commence at "C".  A shuttle will be available from "B" to "C".  You should totally stop by "A" while you're here.</p>
  
  <h3>Lodging</h3>
  <p><a href="http://hotwire.com">HotWire</a> is a reasonable resource for finding hotels in the city.  The best area's to look for are Union Square East, SOMA, or Nob Hill.  You'll want to steer clear of Civic Center.</p>
  <p>I would also suggest checking out Air BnB.  <a href="http://airbnb.com/travel/san+francisco/ca?checkin=2009-09-25&lng=-122.421996&checkout=2009-09-27&page=1&precision=address&state=CA&guests=1&city=San+Francisco&country=US&lat=37.759509">This search</a> shows you people that are willing to rent their room out ordered by distance from my apartment.  There is also a Hostel / Hotel a block from our apartment <a href="http://www.elementshotel.com/">Hotel Elements</a>.</p>
  <p>If you are having trouble finding a place, I can reach out to some friends and probably find you something, just let me know.</p>
  
  <h3>Transportation</h3>
  <p>You can fly into San Francisco (SFO) or Oakland (OAK).  SFO is a bit easier to get into the city via public transportation.  <a href="http://bart.gov">BART</a> will take you near my home "A" or downtown to SOMA / Union Square.  The public bus and trolley system (MUNI) is also very convenient.  You can easily get away without having a car in San Francisco</p>
